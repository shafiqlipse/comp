<p>“We should not remove some events from our education calendar when normalcy returns because all over the world, talent is the biggest industries. It must be well taken care of,” Orero said in a terse message to the Ministry of Education not to exclude co-curricular activities from the school calendar when normalcy resumes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Orero said KSSSA has consulted other members of Federation of East Africa Secondary Schools Sports Association (FEASSSA) and they were all in agreement that all options must be considered to ensure co-curricular activities are held even if it means using the shortest time possible.</p>

<p>“Sports is a big industry and one of the biggest income generating industries in Kenya. We adjust our schedules and play however short the time available is,” Orero said.</p>

<p>Orero, who is also the principal of Dagorreti High School in Nairobi County, said that KSSSA was happy that the government was fighting to control the spread of coronavirus. He expressed hope that secondary school games shall continue from where they were stopped when schools reopen.</p>

		<Title>USSSA bends rules to accommodate COVID-19 affected athletes in schools sports</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Aloysius Byamukama</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) Ball games are near resumption, the association has decided to revise the eligibility rules due to the shortfalls caused by the outbreak of Covid 19 and its resultant lockdowns and suspension of schools sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has been two years of no schools sports activities, but following the president’s suspension of the lockdown and opening of social events, the schools are set to get back to competitions, with USSSA having released the calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While speaking to the delegates in the association Annual General Meeting (AGM) at Old Kampala SS on Friday, association president Patrick Okanya confirmed that some of the rules especially age will be bent in favour of all the athletes due to the missed years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our tournaments have been limited to athletes below 20 years and because there have been years of no activity, we shall have it raised to U-21 to compensate the years missed. But this we shall do in Uganda and then go ahead to lobby for the same at the regional level when it comes to FEASSSA games,” Okanya said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the new set-up, Okanya clarified that athletes born from 2000 will now be eligible to take part in the national games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting presided over by commissioner physical education and sports Rev Can Duncans Mugumya, who represent state minister for sports Denis Obua, was also attended by NCS assistant GS Dick Katende and federation presidents Sarah Babirye of UNF and Moses Muhangi of UBF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his remarks, Mugumya asserted that the opening of schools opened the doors to the resumption of schools sports, and called upon all school heads to embrace the government programs in schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We thank you the school heads and directors for the contributions you make in the ministry of education and sports. I urge you to keep sports in schools because it’s one way of keeping the students’ discipline,” Mugumya said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A minute of silence was observed for the fallen Uganda sports personalities Douglas Kigozi Kafumbe former teacher at Nabisunsa Girls, Aldo Otto the former Gulu district sports officer, Max Omega and former commissioner ministry of education Martin Osban.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting also agreed on changes in the association constitution and affirmative action on the 3rd&nbsp;deputy president was reserved for a female, among other changes.</p>

		<Title>UBF’s Muhangi pleads for restoration of Boxing in schools</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:post-title /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>By Aloysius Byamukama</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda Boxing Federation (UBF) president Moses Muhangi, has pleaded with the ministry of education and sports, to restore boxing back in schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muhangi, who has returned as the federation president for the second term after being unopposed by the closure of presidential candidates nominations last week, attended Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) annual general meeting as an invited guest and when he was invited to speak on behalf of other federations, not in the USSSA competitions, he spoke out his plea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our sport is being sidelined and there’s no way a sports discipline can prosper when it's cut off the grassroots processes and schools are the hub of any sport development. I have begged for this to no avail and I here beg again, Mr Commissioner, kindly bring boxing back in schools,” Muhangi said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting presided over by commissioner physical education and sports Rev Can Duncans Mugumya, who represent state minister for sports Denis Obua, was also attended by NCS assistant GS Dick Katende and federation presidents Sarah Babirye of UNF and Muhangi of UBF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muhangi blamed then physical education and sports Dan Tamwesigire, for banning the sport from schools, which he said was not a right decision for boxing is the safest sport at the amateur level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have tried to ask for that letter banning boxing so I go to court, but I have not got it. People understand football, they understand athletics but they don’t understand boxing and all this is happening because there’s a man called Tamwesigire. Hon commissioner our performance internationally is not good because we don’t have youngsters coming up,” Muhangi said</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adding, “Boxing is the safest because no one inflicts injury on the other because an athlete of junior and youth age cannot box without headgear to protect the skulls and I don’t know any other sort that protects skulls like boxing. Boxers have to have their medical checks before entering the ring, so commissioner take our message and see that boxing is restored back in schools,”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response, commissioner Mugumya said, “Boxing has had their complaint before but we need to find out from our previous leaders why the sport was removed, see the concerns and then see how we can work on them together with other stakeholders like NCS and associations in schools and then see how okay it is to have it back,”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>USSSA president Patrick Okanya, in his communication, said the association is looking at how to include combat games (karate, boxing and kickboxing) since they played at schools international level where Uganda participates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boxing was scrapped from the schools' calendar in a February 2009 communication by then-commissioner Dan Tamwesigire, to then IOC sports education and development officer Thomas Sithole, as he was quoted saying the sport was not safe for the school children, thus:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These children are young and cannot stand punches on their heads. We want to guarantee their safety. Unless I get a clear explanation of the mental effects of boxing to these young men and women, I will scrap it from the schools' calendar. If the gloves make it safer how come someone is punched on the head and becomes unconscious? They can only hold it (schools boxing) unofficially,” Tamwesigire quoted as having said and pleas by then UABF president Roger Ddungu went to a deaf ear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until its scrapping, schools like&nbsp;Kololo High, Kako SS, Kisugu College, Dynamic College, Nyakasula School and Entebbe SS were leading boxing schools that produced prominent boxers Godfrey Nyakana and Justine Jjuko.</p>

		<Title>Tamwesigire responds to Muhangi on boxing ban in schools￼</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>By Aloysius Byamukama</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former commissioner of physical education and sports Dan Tamwesigire has come out with a response to his decision to stop boxing in schools in Uganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tamwesigire ordered the banning of the sport in Ugandan schools in 2009 when he was serving in the same position, and efforts by Uganda Boxing Federation (UBF) to revise the decision has been futile since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While speaking on behalf of federation heads during the Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Associations (USSSA) annual general meeting last Friday at Old Kampala SS, UBF president Moses Muhangi&nbsp;blamed Tamwesigire for taking the decision he said was not a right one to take and has since had a negative impact on the sport, pleading with the current commissioner Rev Can Duncans Mugumya to help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have tried to ask for that letter banning boxing so I go to court, but I have not got it. People understand football, they understand athletics but they don’t understand boxing and all this is happening because there’s a man called Tamwesigire. Hon commissioner our performance internationally is not good because we don’t have youngsters coming up,” Muhangi said</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Tamwesigire has responded in a sound that affirms his decision and is not ready to advise differently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If his Federation can meet the basic safety requirements as listed by the International Boxing Federation (to which UBF is affiliated) let him go ahead and organize the sport in our (Uganda) schools. But I am yet to know a teacher training institution which has Boxing in its curriculum,” Tamwesigire said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adding, “Importantly, for any activity to be done at school SAFETY is paramount. We should not do an activity because others are doing it. You may wish to Google safety in Boxing for the youth. Do you know of any sport whose main objective is to disable (knock out) the opponent even if most contests are won on points?,” Tamwesigire responded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>USSSA president Patrick Okanya says the association is looking at how to include combat games (karate, boxing and kickboxing) since they played at schools international level where Uganda participates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commissioner Mugumya says they will seat as a ministry and find out from the previous leaders why the sport was removed, then see the concerns and then devise means of working on them together with other stakeholders like NCS and associations in schools before taking a decision on whether to have it back or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boxing was scrapped from the schools' calendar in a February 2009 communication by Tamwesigire, to then IOC sports education and development officer Thomas Sithole, as he was on a technical visit to Uganda.</p>

		<Title>USSSA introduces Basketball 3*3 in schools competitions</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>By Aloysius Byamukama</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) has moved a step towards achieving its major objective of enabling all students in schools to discover and exercise their talents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This, the association has done by including Basketball 3*3 to be competed for by schools during the ball games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to USSSA president Patrick Okanya, the unique sport has been included in the Ball Games II category because of the recent successes Uganda has registered at the international level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a conglomeration of several aspects that we reached the decision. First, it’s our interest that every student gets an opportunity to showcase their talents in different sports disciplines. It's also an exciting sport and even then winning the ISF U15 boys’ title was a motivation,” Okanya said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, Uganda took part in the International Schools Sports Federation (ISF) games in Belgrade, Serbia and Uganda boys’ basketball 3*3 team beating the hosts to the event gold was the major highlight of the nation’s&nbsp;9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;overall finish of the 36 countries with 7 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>USSSA has already identified 6 girls and 6 boys that started preparations in the same sport, ahead of the ISF U-18 games due in Normandy, France in May this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda is among the top five nations that play basketball 3*3 on the African continent with Uganda clubs and universities having competed for both at the regional and continental level with the latest having been the national U16 team’s participation in the FIBA Africa Championship in Cairo, Egypt last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year’s USSSA national competitions are scheduled for April/May with the Fresh Diary games (Girls football, basketball, racket games (tennis, table tennis and badminton), Rugby 15s and Hockey) and Copa Coca Cola (boys football) and ball games II (athletics, netball, rugby 7s, wood ball, boys’ U16 football, volleyball and now basketball 3*3 for July, all in the northern region at venues yet to be named</p>

<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schools Table Tennis stars Philip Napookoli and Flavia Amaniyo took an early lead after the second set of the Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) table tennis athletes trials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trail series is organized by USSSA in liaison with the Uganda Table Tennis Association (UTTA) ahead of the International Schools Sports Federation (ISF) Gymnasiade U18 games in Normandy, France in May.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>8 top athletes in both boys and girls categories are vying for the top four slots to represent Uganda at the games and in order to wipe out any complaints of team selection, the two associations agreed to have a series of round-robin competitions from which the topping athletes will make the France team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And from the second set of trials held at MTN Arena, Lugogo on Sunday, Napookoli and Amaniyo are leading the boys and girls tables respectively with 26 points each.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Amaniyo is taking a 1 point lead off second-placed Shanita Namaala, Napookoli seems to be facing a stiff challenge from Wasswa Kikomeko with whom they share the points (26) but the Kibuli SS ace tops on a head-on rule as he beat Mbogo College’s Kikomeko 3-0 on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Napookoli has not found any hardships beating the entire 7 opponents in the first and second series, and will only be waiting to extend his lead and nearness to the Normandy trip, in the third series of challenge next month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kokomeko’s only undoing was his 3-2 narrow win over Isma Lubango that lessened his points, and will only need to consolidate his position away from 3rd&nbsp;placed Tendo Kasoma at 23 points and Mahad Sserunjogi who is in 4th&nbsp;on 22 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, Amayilo, who went down 3-2 to 2nd&nbsp;placed Shanita Namara, was only saved by Namara’s double loss to Amina Nampeera (3-2) and Kelly Ayikolu (3-1) and will have to take care in the next and last two rounds in March and April before thinking of cementing her slot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the 8 girls and 8 boys undergoing these trials are capable of making the cut to the games considering how each of them recovered from the first two sets into the last two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The trials are ongoing smoothly and we are contented that we shall have the best table tennis team, including other teams because the best athletes will be chosen,” Said USSSA president Patrick Okanya.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 19th&nbsp;edition of the ISF games due May 14-22 in Normandy, France will be competed for by only school-going athletes born between 2004-2006 and Uganda is expected to field athletes in table tennis, badminton, basketball 3*3, athletics, chess and swimming whose preparations also started early this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Table Tennis athletes undergoing trials</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two years of Uganda secondary schools sports blackout are finally over and the light has been seen at the tunnel end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the ministry of education and sports, having given the resumption of sports competitions in schools and a circular having been sent out to all schools in regard to this, the Secondary Schools Sports fraternity has every reason now to smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event organized by Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) and attracts only the top 8 teams in only football, netball, volleyball and basketball, was last played in 2020.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have been holding this event as a curtain-raiser to the major national championships and also arouse competition at the national level as school teams will always tussle it out for these top positions so as to make the elite mark,” Okanya said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okanya says that since its inception, the high competition has enabled Uganda to perform well at the regional games and it’s no wonder that Uganda is the reigning FEASSSA games champions after winning the accolade in the last event held in 2019 in Arusha, Tanzania.</p>

<p>The happiness, the joy and the cheering is back, as secondary schools in Uganda get ready for the first national championships after 2 years of no activity due to the pandemic that closed the entire universe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Arua and Gulu will be the places to be for the USSSA boys football and the Fresh Diary respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>The activity that had earlier been scheduled to take place on Monday April 11, was pushed to Wednesday to give some of the regions time to complete their qualifiers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The draws for both the Uganda Secondary Schools football boys Championship Arua 2022 and that of Fresh Dairy games Gulu 2022, have been postponed to Wednesday 13th April 2022 at USSSA head office.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Yes today we conducted the draws for both girls football and the basketball for both girls and boys, why we conducted them here not at the venue, it’s to give chance to these schools to get ready before the kick off date.” He said before adding,  “last time we had 32 teams in girls football but we decided to add on more teams to 64 because we are not going to be with our sponsor, it’s the schools to facilitate themselves, that’s why did so.”</p><p></p></blockquote>

		<Title>Justus Mugisha: Great Success at 2022 Championship Arua, Lessons learnt</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Uganda Secondary Schools National Football Championship Arua 2022 Was a Great Success. Because Of the Lessons Learnt, 2023 Will Even be Much Better</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the last 26 or so years, the Copa Coca-Cola championship was the most well organized, sponsored and popular school sport championship in Uganda. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Haji Sentongo, Haji Kawase, Raphael Bwire, Kennedy Mutenyo and all, the support of NCS , the Ministry of Education and Sports, the ever increasing sponsorship by Coca-Cola.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it was rumoured that Coca-cola had pulled out, I could not beleive it. The confirmation of the romour left many of us devastated. The possibility of staging the boys championship without Coca-cola was unimaginable. Despite the then fears and uncertainty, I am glad the the championship has been held and in great style. Braking many previous records of participation, attendance, TV viewership and general organization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In attendence were 66 teams, 1320 student players, 132 registered team officials, 33 live matches were telecast and streamed live by FUFA TV. Players and officials registered online into the new USSSA System, accreditation cards for all registered players were made available on the first day of the championship and distributed to teams after screening. Draws made days before the championship. Full fixtures availed on the first day of the championship. Daily changes and tables standings were also consistently made available throughout the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how could we fail when we are operating under the guidance of a Commissioner of physical education and sports who is not only an ardent lover of school sport, but who as a school head, consistently participated in the games, with exprienced administrators at USSSA, the greatly improved structures of USSSA and the great support from FUFA, PES and NCS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much as the championship was a great success, a number of challenges, that have to be resolved in order for that of 2023 to even be greater, have been identified.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To begin with, the new system of online registration was a great challenge to many. This was in part due to the fact that a good number of games teachers had not been trained on the system. The problem was even worse by those that are computer illiterate and those that could not seek advice. Players who had played for other schools this year, were able to be registered in the system. The length of time between registration and the tournament did not allow time for verification of documents entered into the system. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going foward, all games teachers will be trained on the system at district and zonal levels ahead of ball games 2. Schools will be required to enter details of all its sporting students into the USSSA system in the first one month of the term 1 after which the system will close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other challenge was clarity of our rules and regulations especially on none eligibility of players and proof of age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an effort to make our rules easy to implement and in line with those of ISF, Some provisions were removed and others left unclear. The unclear rules were taken advantage of by some teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The disciplinary committee could not rule on some cases using the rules without unfairly victimising some teams. This in a way, brought some disrepute to our games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going forward, USSSA, under the guidance of PES will review and bring clarity to the rules and regulations. In particular, it was also observed that the removal of the no repeater rule may have brought on board footballers who left school many years ago. For example, we had cases of some footballers who play for clubs hundreds of miles away from their schools. One wonders how this is can be possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other challenge was disparity in age and may be age cheating. Where as the tournament was an U 21, some schools like St Augustine fielded mainly U17 players. The big teams on the other hand fielded mainly 20 Yr old and a few 19yr old students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was also discovered that many with UNEB verification letters instead of a UNEB pass-slip, are actually over-aged players. They pretend to have lost pass-lips that show age and opt for the letter that do not show age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other associated problem here is that at FEASSSA, we play U20 and at ISF Competitions, we play U19. So some players who helped their teams to qualify for FEASSSA games will be ineligible come the Tabola games in September this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going forward, we shall consider playing U20 or even U19 in future. The under age category games will further be availed and emphasised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UNEB, will through PES, be requested to indicate date of birth on the verification letters. The act of age cheating in this way, will be criminalised and heavy sanctions applied to the defaulters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other challenge was with schools that compete and qualify at the the zone level but lack the resources to compete at national level. This has been compounded by the withdrawal of the sponsor. These bring a lot of uncertainty to our games. That's why we ended up playing 66 teams instead of the planned 64 in Arua this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going forward, we shall now regulate the time period for district and zone qualifiers and leave ample time for registration and replacements. We shall also improve on our means of communication.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Where as in my view the referees tried their best, some of their calls were contested by some fans and officials alike. The few contested calls especially those in matches that was on TV will be reviewed by the referees committee of FUFA and where necessary, action taken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In future, we plan to train at least 4 students per school as referees to officiate in inter house and inter class Competitions. Those who do well will officiate interschool Competitions.</p>

<p>The Uganda’s sensation took part in the 100m freestyle and the 50m butterfly events on Tuesday but not her specialty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have done these two events which in my opinion are not my specialty and it didn’t go well, but its all well because I have seen what I have to work on in the coming days before my events on Thursday.&nbsp; I am looking forward to beating the national record which I currently hold and hopefully win a medal for Uganda,” Kirabo said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kirabo broke the national record in the Women's&nbsp;<strong>50m freestyle</strong>&nbsp;during her Olympics debut at the Tokyo 2020 edition after coming home on 26.63 to beat the previous 26.90 she set at the 2019 FINA World Junior Championships in Budapest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her counterparts at the games Esther Daisy Atto, Swagiah Mubiru and Princes Mugisha will give a supportive performance as they compete in different other categories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boy swimmers Ampaire Namanya, John Kafumbe Jordan Ssetumba and Joshua Wabwire posted personal best records in their categories on Tuesday but couldn’t make it to the finals of the 100m relay as they came 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;on 4:02:23 in a race won by Turkey.</p>

		<Title>Good Finish: Uganda finishes top of Africa at ISF games with 7 medals</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda concluded the 19th edition of the International Schools Sports Federation (ISF) U-18 games in Normandy region in France with 2 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze for a total of 7 medals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1982,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Uganda-Medlay-relay-bronze-winners-are-joined-by-champions-Brazil-1024x800.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1982"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Friday May 20 was the last day for Uganda’s hopes for more gold in athletics in the senior ISF games after taking part for only the second time, after all other three disciplines of basketball, table tennis and swimming had ended with no accolade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1978,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ugandas-800m-stars-Priscilla-Akello-left-and-gold-winner-Maurine-Chebet-right-pause-with-a-Brazillian-athlete-after-the-race-2-1024x878.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1978"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the expected gold medals didn’t come by as Christine Nyawere and Loice Chekwemoi tumbled on the turf in their respective 400m and 1500m finals on a cold breezing morning in Caen and they could not match the conditions. First it was Nyawere in the 400m final and with the sprinter having started well, it became so difficult for her on the 200m bend, as she started limping off holding her lower abdomen showing a lot of pain and the time she came to the line, she was almost walking in pain and lost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1987,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Christine-Nyawere-could-not-finish-the-400m-final-1-984x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1987"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was the rushed off for medication and this eliminated her from the 200m final, robbing Uganda a would be silverware. In the 1500m final too, hopeful Loice Chekwemoi who was the favourite, started falling off the front in the last lap but persisted to finish 7th with a devastating 4:37:76, a race won by Turkey’s Ayya Fidanogru on 4:25.78 while India’s Laxita Vinod took silver on 4:27.38 and Kazakhstan’s Nurmamet Akkayan settled for bronze at 4:27:74.Uganda’s two bronze of the day came from Victor Chekwemoi who made a run of his life in the most competitive 1500m final, after beating three opponents on the final 100m stretch to come home 3rd on 3:57.67 minutes, behind France’s Yanis Mouline who took silver on 3:57.57 with Spain’s Felix Ronaldo winning gold with a 3:57:16 finish.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda again won the Medley long relay bronze as the quartet of Fred Ambayo, Rajab Ibrahim, Dominic Klop and Ryamong Omara put up a good show to finish 3rd position in the seemingly teasing 2oom 4oom, 600m and 800m run, but the girls’ team of Christine Nyawere, Priscilla Akello, Financia Chekwemoi and Maurine Chebet that had finished 2nd was disqualified for a falt exchange of the button.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With these medals; 2 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze, Uganda finished 7th overall and 1st in Africa, a performance USSSA president and Leader of Delegation Patrick Okanya commended</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We are extremely happy for the performance because it has not been an easy go. There are many countries here that prepared enough and came but have gone back empty handed. Who are we to have have this and we don’t cerebrate? We thank Government for the support to USSSA and enabling these kids to come and expose their talents on the globe. We thank the minister of Education Mama Janet Kataaha Museveni and all her junior ministers for the support. The commissioners and the NCS have been here and this shows the support that we have. The parents, the coaches and the athletes in all the 5 disciplines that we took part in. We shall keep improving in every outing that we shall take part in,” Okanya said</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>National Council of Sports (NCS) general secretary Dr Patrick Ogwel was equally thankful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I am happy to note that Uganda is endowed with talent and it’s now time for government to invest more in our athletes especially in the education system which to me would be the foundation. And I want to encourage all our sports leaders especially the federation heads to also invest in the foundation level by arranging competitions for the juniors so they identify the best athletes,” Ogwel said.Adding, “I am surely very excited and it gives me the prestige to say that as council, we look forward to prioritize and ensure that Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) and all other educational institutions games at regional and continental championships, Uganda makes appearance,”</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ogwel’s promises matched with Samia-Bugwe central MP and vice chairman of budget committee of Uganda parliament Dennis Nyangweso, who is also in France on the same fact finding mission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I am here on the delegation of my chairman and its true that sports has not been funded so well, but from 2000 we can talk of some funding from government. I have interacted with different delegations here finding out how they do this. And I realize this calls for enough funding if we want to compete and I will appeal to the government of Uganda to increase the budgeting for sports, the schools games must be supported through adequate budget,” Nyangweso said</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Sam Kuloba, the commissioner secondary education, ministry of education and sports was not different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We are thankful to everyone that has enabled this great performance in all the disciplines though we only managed medals in athletics. But this is a good performance and the ministry is happy and Uganda is happy. As a ministry we are going to look at ways on how we can inject more money at this level of talent identification because we now rwalise that we have the potential of competing at a higher junior level like this," Kuloba said</p></blockquote>

<p>For the boys, it was one way traffic as Kakungulu won 9-0.<br>City High looked like it would hold but James Larombi opened the scoring in the 10th minute. <br>Then the floodgates opened in the second quarter where Larombi scored in the 17th and 29th minutes to complete a hattrick.<br>In between his goals were penalty corner conversations from Brian Ofoyimungu and Nicholas Lukwago in the 18th and 20th minutes respectively.<br>In the second half, Kakungulu scored twice in each quarter to complete the 9-0 rout. Hamis Gulume and Shafic Byamukama scored in the 32nd and 45th minutes while Larombi scored his fourth in the 58th minute shortly before Shafic Abdul converted another penalty corner at the death.<br>"We had a good game but even then you cannot say we did not make individual mistakes as players. We need to style up and take every game seriously," Larombi said.<br>City High skipper Sula Bwabye was frustrated that they "did not pile more pressure by sending more balls upfront" but still remained happy about their efforts and called on his colleagues "to train harder so that the next games are better."</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a bid to ensure tranquil organization of the national finals for the 2023 Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association football championships, a team of USSSA leaders embarked on the last inspection of facilities in the host city of Fort Portal, Kabarole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams traveled to Fort Portal, Kabarole to ascertain the readiness of Nyakusura school in regards to the facilities for accommodation, playing fields and others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inspections commenced on Friday evening through to Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being the rainy season in Fort Portal and the surrounding areas, the visit was important to see the grounds to access how much damage, or if they the grounds can still be playable even in the rainy seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the visits, over 10 grounds were visited to include Buhinga, Bukwali, St Leo’s Kyegobe, St Paul’s Major Seminary, St Mary’s Minor Seminary, St Peter &amp; Paul Primary School field, Kitarasa playground, UTC Kichwamba 2 ground and the PTC Canon Apollo ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NYAKASURA-INSPECTION-10-1024x680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3821"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recommended ones were Kichwamba A &amp; B, Kitarasa, Nyakasura A &amp;B, Canon Apollo, St Mary’s Minor Seminary and Bukwali.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ones on standby are; St Leo’s A, St Peter &amp; Paul Primary School, Major Seminary and Buhinga, if need be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the USSSA Second Vice president and chairperson of the organizing committee, Okot P’Bitek, the inspection was a complete success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Representing the president Justus Mugisha, the second vice president confirmed that Nyakasura is ready to host the different schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We came to Nyakasura for the final inspection of facilities for a follow-up from the earlier visits. Our findings is that the school is ready to host the games almost 90 percent. We visited the play-grounds. We have over 10 playgrounds which are ready. We also checked on the accommodation facilities which are ready and I must say, we are set to receiving schools on the 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;May 2023. The remaining 10 percent is the work that the head teacher is doing on the ground within the remaining one week. I want to inform all Ugandans that we are ready to have the tournament and receive all the teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the inspection process, there was a successful meeting held to brainstorm upon the findings and make key recommendations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rev Canon Balinda E. B Richardson, the head teacher Nyakasura School confirmed their readiness to host the championship given the full support of the school management, local community, local leaders and the broader Rwenzori region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I want to thank the Ministry of Education and Sports exceedingly for giving us the chance to host the school’s football championship. We are humbled that we have been able to receive a team from USSSA as they conducted the final inspection of facilities (playing venues, secretariat and accommodation, among others). We are ready to host the schools, thanks to the overwhelming support from the school management. We also have the support of the community, local leaders and the broader Rwenzori region. The remaining few areas that need urgent attention will be addressed in the remaining few days.” Rev. Canon Balinda stated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rev. Canon Balinda informed that the physical and human infrastructure is all well in place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tournament will start on the 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;May 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A total of 64 schools have been confirmed to take part in this prestigious tournament whose defending champion is St Mary’s Kitende.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top four schools will earn tickets to the FEASSSA Games that are due in Rwanda later this year where Uganda (Kibuli S.S) is the defending champion.</p>

		<Title>New Online Registration Fee for Ball Games II 2023</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Secondary School Sports Stakeholders,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are pleased to announce that during a recent meeting between the Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) Top Executive Committee and the National Association of Secondary Schools Head teachers' in Uganda (ASSHU) Executive Committee on 13th June 2023, a decision was made to revise the charges for online registration for the upcoming Ball Games II 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to ensure maximum participation and inclusivity, it has been resolved to reduce the online registration fee from Ush. 5000 to Ush. 3000 per participant. This revision aims to make it more affordable for schools to register their players and enable a larger number of schools to participate in the Games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We understand the importance of providing equal opportunities for all schools to engage in sports and showcase their talent. By reducing the registration fee, we hope to encourage more schools to actively participate in the Ball Games II 2023 and contribute to the vibrant sporting atmosphere that promotes healthy competition and camaraderie among students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Refunds for Previously Registered Players:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For schools that have already registered their players for the championship at the previous fee of Ush. 5000, we assure you that refunds will be processed accordingly. Our team will reach out to the respective schools to facilitate the refund process and ensure a seamless transition to the revised fee structure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We extend our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused by this change, and we appreciate your understanding and support as we strive to create an inclusive and accessible sporting environment for all schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We remain committed to the development of secondary school sports and fostering a spirit of fair play, teamwork, and excellence among our student-athletes. The USSSA and ASSHU are dedicated to organizing high-quality championships that provide a platform for young talents to showcase their skills and represent their schools with pride.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) expresses its heartfelt condolences to the family members, relatives, friends, and the entire school community affected by the recent terrorist attack on Lhubirira Secondary School in Mpondwe, located just 2 kilometers from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) border. The attack, carried out by ADF rebels, has left the nation in shock and mourning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the horrifying incident that unfolded last night, the Uganda Police reported a terrorist attack on Lhubirira Secondary School. The rebels set fire to a dormitory and looted a food store within the school premises. The consequences of this senseless act of violence have been devastating. To date, the authorities have recovered the bodies of 25 victims from the school, which have been transferred to Bwera Hospital. Additionally, eight individuals remain in critical condition and are receiving urgent medical attention at the same hospital.</p>

<p>The competition is part of the upcoming USSSA Ball Games II scheduled to run from 9th - 18th July 2023. Hosted by St Mary's College Rushoroza in Kabale, will see selected students represent their respective schools, districts, and zones. With the introduction of a scoring system for schools, districts, and zones, individual athletes will now contribute points based on their performances in their respective disciplines.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the revised scoring system:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To summarize the scoring distribution:</strong></p>

		<Title>USSSA Extends Online Registration and Announces Zonal Qualifiers Calendar for 2023 Sporting Calendar</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Date</em>: 17th June 2023</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Kampala, Uganda</em> - In a collaborative effort between the Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) and the Association of Secondary School Headteachers of Uganda (ASSHU), important updates have been made regarding the USSSA Online Registration and the release of the Zonal Qualifiers Calendar for the upcoming 2023 Sporting Calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a successful meeting between USSSA and ASSHU, several decisions were made to enhance the registration process and provide schools with a clear timeline for the zonal qualifiers. These decisions aim to ensure widespread participation and fair competition across all levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, the USSSA Online Registration period has been extended to accommodate schools' needs. Initially scheduled to close on Friday, June 16, 2023, at 11:59 pm, schools now have until Tuesday, June 20, 2023, at 11:59 pm to complete their registration. This extension offers schools additional time to finalize their registration process and guarantees their eligibility for participation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a stern directive, USSSA emphasizes that no school team will be allowed to take part in any level of sporting events without completing the USSSA Online Registration. This requirement ensures that all participating schools are officially registered, creating a level playing field for competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, the eagerly awaited <a href="https://usssaonline.com/zonal-qualifiers-2023-schools-to-compete-for-national-slots-usssa-ball-games-ii/">Zonal Qualifiers Calendar</a> has been unveiled, marking a significant milestone in the preparation for the sporting events. The calendar provides participating schools with a comprehensive schedule of events and important dates leading up to the culmination of the zonal qualifiers on Sunday, July 2, 2023. It is essential for schools to review the calendar diligently and make the necessary arrangements to compete in their respective zones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mugisha Christopher Banage, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of USSSA, expressed his well wishes to all participating schools as they embark on the Sporting Calendar 2023. He emphasized the importance of these sporting events as a platform for students to showcase their talents, foster camaraderie, and promote healthy competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the USSSA strives to uphold the highest standards of organization and fairness, the extended online registration period and the release of the zonal qualifiers calendar will undoubtedly contribute to the success of the forthcoming sporting events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schools are urged to take advantage of the extended registration deadline and complete their <a href="https://usssaug.com/auth/login">USSSA Online Registration</a> promptly. The USSSA Secretariat is available to address any queries or concerns regarding the registration process or the zonal qualifiers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With anticipation building, the school sports fraternity eagerly awaits the commencement of the 2023 Sporting Calendar, which promises to be an exciting showcase of talent, dedication, and sportsmanship.</p>

<p>Dance sport, as one of the youngest sports in Uganda, has been gaining momentum and popularity, thanks to the concerted efforts of UDSF in collaboration with USSSA zonal leaders and the technical team.

<p>To ensure equal opportunities and representation, the USSSA has allocated 12 slots for both boys and girls in the dance sport category.

		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Njeru, Uganda - The FUFA Technical Centre in Njeru played host to an important gathering as Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) officials Christopher Mugisha Banage, CEO, and Patrick Alfred Okanya, President Emeritus, joined a one-day symposium. The symposium, organized by the Federation of Uganda Football Associations (FUFA), aimed to discuss and devise a comprehensive National Football Technical Plan for the period 2023-2030.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bringing together a diverse range of key stakeholders, experts, and professionals from various domains within the football industry, the symposium aimed to foster collaboration in shaping a strategic and all-encompassing technical plan for the nation's football.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As leaders in the USSSA, both Christopher Mugisha Banage and Patrick Alfred Okanya demonstrated their commitment to advancing sports and nurturing talent among Uganda's youth. Their participation in the symposium highlighted the association's dedication to contributing to the growth and development of football in the country.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The football technical plan, under discussion at the symposium, was driven by a mission focused on achieving three key objectives. Firstly, it aims to establish mass football for all, with the goal of ensuring that football reaches every corner of Uganda. By encouraging widespread participation, this initiative aims to create a solid foundation for the sport's growth at all levels and provide opportunities for aspiring players across the country.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Secondly, the plan seeks to cultivate a high-performance culture for elite performers. Through the provision of advanced training facilities, specialized coaching programs, and comprehensive support systems, Uganda aims to nurture and elevate its most talented players, enabling them to compete at the highest levels of the sport.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third objective of the plan is to establish a universal playing style for Uganda's national teams and clubs, which will result in producing entertaining and purposeful football. This ambitious vision aims to raise the profile of Ugandan football, attract global recognition, and create opportunities for players and clubs to showcase their skills on the international stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the symposium, several key pillars were discussed to shape the technical plan. These pillars include mass football, which focuses on broadening access and inclusivity to the sport; elite football, which emphasizes the development of top-tier players and teams; professional football, which aims to enhance the overall infrastructure and commercial aspects of the sport; life after football, which addresses the well-being and post-career support for players; coach education, which aims to produce skilled and knowledgeable coaches; talent identification, which seeks to identify and nurture promising young talent; referees development, which emphasizes training and support for match officials; and finally, medicine, science, and technology, which explores advancements in sports science to enhance player performance and well-being.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The symposium provided a valuable platform for experts to exchange ideas, share experiences, and collectively develop a roadmap for the future of Ugandan football.

<p>One key area of discussion was the establishment of fully-fledged School Sports Federations in each country, aiming to provide a platform for organized sports competitions and events at the national level. Additionally, they explored the idea of introducing zonal school sports competitions in the five regions of Africa. Such regional competitions would not only foster healthy competition but also serve as a means of talent identification and promotion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another significant topic was the vision for FASS to operate independently and autonomously in implementing its activities, particularly in organizing competitions at the continental level. This aspiration aligns with the objective of creating a robust and self-sustaining structure for school sports across Africa, thereby ensuring the continuous growth and success of the movement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expressing gratitude to his host, Justus Mugisha acknowledged Mamadou Souleymane Kone as a brother, friend, and comrade. The meeting served as an important platform for collaboration and mutual learning, laying the foundation for future cooperation in advancing school sports in Africa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Mugisha returns to Uganda, armed with newfound knowledge and experiences, the expectation is that his involvement with ISF, FASS, and FUFA will be further strengthened. With a shared vision for the development of school sports, it is anticipated that collaborations between Uganda and Cote D'Ivoire, as well as other African nations, will contribute to the continued growth and success of the African school sports movement.</p>

<p>In December 2022, the inaugural USSSA Capacity Building Program was held at Kibuli Secondary School, attracting over 500 participants, including students and teachers. The success of the program sparked interest, and it quickly spread across the entire country. Two additional training sessions were subsequently held in Western Uganda at Mbarara High School and in the Teso Zone at Amus College. Patrick Okanya, the Program Chairman and USSSA President Emeritus, commended the dedication of the students and schools involved in the training.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We would like to thank schools and students who have embraced this training, which is school-government sponsored because they have made it powerful and shining," he remarked proudly. Regarding the impact of the training program, Okanya emphasized, "Currently, all the games in Kabale have officials who are our products from the December and January training sessions, which empowers us because we have started harvesting fruits." "From 2025, Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association shall be using its own products to officiate our games, coaches coaching schools, and media officers covering our games will be our products," Mr. Patrick insisted, outlining the association's vision for the future. </p>

<p><em>Kabale, July 17, 2023</em> – The picturesque town of Kabale played host to nine days of exhilarating sporting action during the 2023 USSSA Ball Games II. From the bustling corridors of St. Mary's College Rushoroza, the host school, to the vibrant town center, Kabale witnessed an unprecedented influx of sports enthusiasts and participants, turning it into a hub of sportsmanship and camaraderie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eagerly awaited games, which commenced on July 9, came to a thrilling climax on Monday, July 17, with deserving winners across various disciplines recognized and awarded for their outstanding performances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The closing ceremony, held at the Kabale Main Stadium, was graced by the esteemed presence of the State Minister for Sports in the Ministry of Education and Sports, Hon. Peter Ogwang. Joining him were Commissioner for Physical Education in the Ministry of Education and Sports, Rev.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I am here to warn schools that use non-students and those that practice age cheating. The new sports law which awaits ascent from H.E the President is tough on this. We shall arrest headteachers, games teachers, and ban schools and students who are found guilty."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the 2023 ISF WSC Football tournament concluded in Rabat, Morocco, the participating countries seized an invaluable opportunity to enhance their athletes' knowledge and safety through anti-doping and safeguarding workshops.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second segment, focusing on safeguarding in sport, was led by the experienced duo of Doherty Kieran and Charles Oriana. They conducted a thought-provoking session that delved into various types of harm and abuses, ranging from physical and sexual to emotional (mental) and bullying.</p>

<p>"The draws were conducted with utmost transparency and integrity. We hold sanguine expectations for the well-prepared teams representing their nations.

<p>"Today's draws were carefully orchestrated, taking several factors into account," said Patrick Okanya, the Chairman of the draws. "First and foremost, we aimed to ensure that the participating students could indulge in the joy of the game by maximizing their opportunities to play. Equally significant was our commitment to fostering transparency in these draws. Another pivotal consideration was the separation of teams hailing from the same country, a measure aimed at preventing the irony of competing against your own team both at home and away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given these imperatives, we confronted a scenario where a discipline boasted an impressive 11 teams. Our response was to organize these teams into two distinct groups, a practical solution. Regrettably, a few countries were unable to partake, narrowing the competition down to Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Our division into pools, A and B, took into account the teams ranked 7 and below. Thus, a round-robin format was implemented, culminating in a direct round-robin conclusion, foreclosing the necessity for a final match beyond this stage," he explained.</p>

<p>St. Mary’s College Kisubi are on the cusp of winning the boys’ rugby 15s title at the ongoing Federation of East Africa Secondary Schools Sports Association (FEASSSA) Games in Huye, Rwanda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This follows a nail-biting 18-12 over the highly billed Kenyan side Butula on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hisham Kabanda, Benjamin Mukisa and Darren Aine scored tries while Mathew Musasizi scored a drop goal for Smack. Smack went into the halftime break leading 8-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butula’s Derrick Ouma and Emmanuel Adoyo were on the score-sheet too. Melvin Wekesa converted one of their tries to ensure the first half left fans on the edges of their seats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smack, who have now won three on the trot, have to ensure they win in the final game against St. Anthony on Saturday morning to carry the trophy back to Kisubi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a tight game but we got the victory that we deserved,” Smack captain Michael Musiimenta said in the aftermath of the game before adding that “we know Saturday’s game is a must win and we are in good shape to make it happen.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jinja out</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But while gold is possible for Uganda in the 15s, bronze can only be the best outcome in the 7s, where Jinja SS lost 17-07 to Kenya’s Koyonzo in the semifinals.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kakungulu want to defend the trophy they won in Tanzania last year and their captain Frank Wambalya believes the country can count on them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today’s (Thursday) game was not easy but we managed to pull through and we now look towards winning the final,” Wambalya said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kakungulu play Kenyan side Musingu, who beat counterparts St. Anthony 3-2 in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw in regulation time in the other semifinal, on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the boys’ chances are promising, things look a bit more complicated for Kakungulu’s girls who are in a round-robin competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They have 10 points from five games – three behind Kenyan sides Nyamira and St. Joseph Kitale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nyamira are Kenyan champions but Kakungulu must beat them by at least eight goals on Saturday to stand a chance of defending the prestigious trophy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph beat Kakungulu 2-0 on Thursday while Nyamira whitewashed Bweranyangi 5-0 for the Kenyan sides to go into their final fixtures with a shot at gold.</p>

<p>Huye, Rwanda - Excitement and anticipation are reaching fever pitch as the stage is set for the grand finale of the 2023 Federation of East Africa Secondary Schools Sports Association (FEASSSA) football championship.

<p>St. Mary's Kitende secured their place in the final with a hard-fought victory over St. Henry’s College Kitovu, winning 2-1 in a tense semifinal clash at Kamena Stadium, Rwanda.

<p>James Larombi left it late but will hardly care about the timing as his solitary goal earned Kakungulu Memorial yet another triumph in the boys’ hockey competition at the Federation of East Africa Secondary School Sports Association (FEASSSA) Games in Huye, Rwanda on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larombi’s goal came in the 54th minute of a pulsating final played in the Huye afternoon heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tense final with Musingu bent on ensuring the trophy that eluded Kenyan teams last year returns home after a year’s spell in Kampala.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"linkTo":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Kakungulu showed good game management to ensure they were not broken in their tough periods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kenya, however, took consolation in having two teams on the podium as St. Anthony beat Ugandan side St. Mary’s College Kisubi 2-0 in the third place playoff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately for Kakungulu, it was not a clean sweep as their girls’ team lost a decisive encounter to Kenyan champions Nyamira 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kakungulu came into this final game in a tight spot as they had to beat Nyamira by at least eight goals to have a chance of defending their trophy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Ugandan side could not breach the Kenyans’ defence and ended up letting in two goals to finish the competition with 10 points – six behind the new regional champions Nyamira.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nyamira, like St. Joseph Kitale, did not concede a goal in the tournament but scored 21 to get ahead of their Kenyan counterparts on goal difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things kept getting worse for Kakungulu as Tigoi kept pumping goals against Gayaza High School in the other match played in the mid-morning sun. Tigoi won 13-0 to also get to 10 points and ensure they pushed Kakungulu completely out of the medal bracket.</p>

<p><strong>SMACK captain: FEASSSA rugby triumph, a dream come true</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BOYS’ RUGBY -15s</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All Saints (Ke) 09-23 SMACK</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Budo (Ug) 00-26 St. Anthony</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mathew Musasizi was named most valuable player after his two penalties and a conversion helped St. Mary’s College Kisubi (SMACK) to the Federation of East Africa Secondary School Association (FEASSSA) Games’ boys’ rugby title in Huye, Rwanda on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:cover {"url":"https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rugby-1024x683.jpg","id":5757,"dimRatio":50,"isDark":false,"style":{"color":{}}} -->

<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Musasizi and his SMACK teammates beat Kenyan counterparts All Saints 23-9 in a largely one sided match to top the round robin competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SMACK’s tries were scored by Ethan Mugabi, Abraham Ggayi and captain Michael Musiimenta while Josphat Karanja was clinical with the boot as his three penalties helped St. Anthony put some points on board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The trophy did not come on a silver platter; guys worked for it, put their shoulders on the line and worked hard,” Musiimenta said of his team’s triumph that makes them the third Ugandan team to do so after Namilyango College last year and Hana in 2009 and 2011.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The previous years have been dominated by Kenyan schools like Laiser Hill, Kakamega and Maseno. It is clear to see why Musiimenta feels this was a huge moment for the history of their school and Ugandan rugby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I would like to thank my teammates, coach (Alvin Nkamba), school administration, our parents and our friends out there for the support they have given us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This (captaining SMACK to the regional trophy) is something I will never forget. It is a dream come true,” Musiimenta added. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it was all celebrations and cheers in the SMACK camp, Brian Makalama’s King’s College Budo failed to regroup in the entire tournament and that was summed up by a 26-0 hiding from St. Anthony on the final day of the competition.</p>

		<Title>USSSA ,Primary Schools marriage made in heaven</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda Secondary School Sports Association (USSSA) president Justus Mugisha believes their partnership with their primary schools counterparts “is a match made in heaven.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking at the closing ceremony and later dinner of the August 28 to September 5 National&nbsp;Primary School &nbsp;Ball games at Kakyeeka stadium, Mugisha said the move will ensure that “in a few years Uganda will be at the top of the world because all games start in school.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You (Ministry of Education and Sports) asked us to cooperate with schools and also asked us to work with (sports) federations for maximum results and we are onto that,” Mugisha said addressing the Commissioner Physical Education and Sports in the Ministry of Education and Sports Rev. Canon Duncans Mugumya, who was the chief guest on the day.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We took 14 years to win the FEASSSA Games. Now for the third year running, we are winning and with a big margin.But what is important is not that we are beating Kenya but that we are contributing immensely to sports development in the region”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, despite all this, we still came to a conclusion that starting sports at secondary school level is too late. So we tried to put up U-16 tournaments but nothing was changing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;That is why we have returned to collaborate &nbsp;with the primary schools,” Mugisha said at the games which were broadcast on the USSSA YouTube channel and where the body held capacity building training for the teachers. Mugisha also promised the body has the money to push this to district level unlike the case in Mbarara where each district was allowed up to two participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Incentivizing primary schools</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike USSSA, which brings the winning school teams to the nationals, the primary school association brings district select teams to the national games. Although this theoretically brings the very best talents, it ends up demotivating the schools, which put in so much to develop these talents. At the national level, the sporting primary schools get no mileage out of their investment. Secondly, the teams have to camp before the games at national, which takes the pupils out of their schools for prolonged periods of time, hence missing out on academics</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mugisha also added that there are challenges like financing that need to be addressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We can work together to ensure games in schools can be financed by government. In Kigali, we had many MPs and they were interested in having this discussion.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mugisha also shared that there should be participation incentives for the primary schools as the ISF (World School Federation) Games are not for only secondary school going students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda will need more games to help it win at international level. The FEASSSA games where some of these teams could have gotten more competition ended on the same day these primary school games were starting. Uganda, therefore, missed an opportunity to win both the primary and secondary categories at the just concluded FEASSSA Games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>School games competitions are for different age categories; U-12, U-14, and U-16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Age cheating</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was observed that the age categorization is not dependent on the date of birth but rather a unit reached according to one height and weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tall kids and those who are well fed end up being disadvantaged by the system. Unfortunately, it's the tall athletes that are on demand in most, if not all, sports disciplines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Unlike at secondary, where players are registered online and verified prior to the championship, in the primary games, players are weighted, categorized, and registered on arrival. The organizers have no knowledge about the number in the different categories prior to this process. As such, draws and fixtures delay for as many as two days. The registration forms do not have a field for the school attended by pupils nor the pupils' EMIS number. It's therefore difficult to verify whether the athletes go to school. It is highly suspected that a good number of athletes in the U-16 category are actually&nbsp; secondary school students,” added Mugisha, who has the experience as a director at Standard High School – Zzana, first vice president fufa, president of USSSA, president of FEASSSA for 20 years, and president technical commission for football ISF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Feeding issues</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mugisha also noted that “unlike USSSA games, where we have centralized feeding, at primary games, each district fends for itself. The children are at the mercy of the officials who travel with the team. This also creates classes as some children are fed on rice and chicken, while others take porridge for meals. No wonder some teams could not honor all their fixtures after running out of upkeep funds.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Free-up games</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The president also advised that the students be given more playing time instead of putting them under strict competition rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Do not eliminate teams at preliminaries. Have them play classification games so that each team plays the same number of games. Kids need to play as many games as possible,” Mugisha said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this, he was backed by Mugumya who added that “This (primary schools) championship is not intended for gold, silver or bronze medals but to identify talent and get an opportunity to nurture it for a good future.”</p>

<p>Uganda Secondary School Sports Association (USSSA) are pushing to have all stakeholders on board in terms of sports development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The executive led by president Justus Mugisha spent the better part of the week in Soroti as part of the Association of Secondary School Headteachers of Uganda (ASSHU) Annual General Meeting (AGM) held at Teso College, Aloet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The headteachers are seen as key internal stakeholders that could help USSSA make strides in the eight strategic areas of; administration, communications, competitions, governance, infrastructure and facilities, marketing, talent identification, and technical development –in the 2022-2026 period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this term, USSSA, according to Mugisha, seek to grow the existing competitions to include more of the disciplines like dance sport, lacrosse, woodball, beach (soccer, volleyball) and mind games plus also popularize athletics inter-school competitions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The association has also introduced age category games but seeks to do it for all sports (U15, U16) and also start Sunday Leagues for major sports in cities and towns across the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>USSSA has also trained 4,236 students and teachers but is now trying to encourage them to participate in the games as referees, coaches, administrators, media officers and volunteers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Annual General Meeting</strong><strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“Uganda has been facing a challenge, especially in the refereeing area. Usually, most of them have been starting to learn the trade after university".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time they get the necessary qualifications and experience, they are too old. So we have not been getting enough international referees in the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Great opportunities</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, we have 13 year olds in this training getting their first refereeing certificates. It means that if they get the opportunities to grow, they will advance quite quickly.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Entebbe Parents’ Nickitah Bukenya is one of the enthusiastic learners in this area and is looking forward to push her school to incorporate her into the games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I hope to get even more opportunities in school so I can grow this career,” Bukenya said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During this training, USSSA also introduced the first aid and injury prevention course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What we need to do is educate the coaches back at school mostly on injury prevention. These injuries can come tough the drills that the coaches give so we need very good training in this area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, we have learned more things like dealing with sprains, bleeding, drowning, near-drowning among others,” Christine Nabwire, a teacher from Luweero but also with experience in athletics officiating, said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The training will continue in January 2024.</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>A meeting has been held on Wednesday 20th December 2023, at the USSSA offices chaired by the President Justus Mugisha to brief the representatives of the schools of what will be required of them and the support that will be provided by both USSSA and the government of Uganda through the department of Physical Education and Sports, Ministry of Education and Sports.<br>The representatives were from the following schools.<br>Ngora High School, Ntare School, Kawanda SS, Bukedea Comprehensive School, St. Mary’s Boarding Kitende, Kawempe Muslim, Elite High School ,St. Henry’s Kitovu,Kibuli SS,Buddo SS ,St. Noa Girls’ Zana,Nabisunsa Girls ,Namugongo Secondary and Vocational School,Mbogo High School ,Mbogo College School,Kakungulu Memorial School ,Bethel Covenant ,Hope SS Nakirebe,Gombe SS ,Ssaku SS ,Standard High School Zzana,Kinaawa High School Kawempe and Amus College.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The are several championships namely<br>ISF world Schools volley ball championship ,19-29th April in Belgrade Serbia.<br>ISF World Schools Cross Country, May 10-15th May 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya.<br>ISF World School Football Championship 17-27 2024 in Dalian, P.R China.<br>ISF World Schools Basketball Championship June 23-03 July 2024 in Macao China.<br>ISF World Gymnasia in 23-31st October 2024 Manama City, Bahrain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>“Once the schools/teams agree to travel their accommodation, meals, participation fee and uniforms will be funded by the association (USSSA). There will also be some pocket money to all members of each delegation. School will however be required to fund their air tickets”<br>Schools will be required to fund their air tickets, travel insurance, letters of affidavit and passports for the travelling contingents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>“We have called you to exchange ideas specifically to know those who can afford and those who cannot afford, because registration for a few disciplines is already on yet to close. Therefore, if you cannot afford let us know earlier so that a school that can afford is given this chance”. Justus Mugisha said</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The President emphasized to the representatives the importance of participating in games at this level which is both a marketing tool and financial gain. For example, Kawempe Muslim Girls and St. Mary’s Boarding Kitende who have just won at the CAF Schools Championship each winning 100,000 US Dollars (Three hundred seventy million) each. The two schools stand a chance to win even more when they play at the continental championship in April 2024.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Kawempe Muslim SS -Ayub Khalifa Kiyingi<br>“The girls were mainly senior ones because the championship was Under 14. They were excited by both the accommodation and meals. Thank you (USSSA) for their 100 USD upkeep you have to each of the girls. We promise to work even harder when we go to the continental stage in April 2024”.<br>Mr. Mugisha also asked the teachers from Kibuli SS, Buddo SS and St. Noa Girls’ Zana on how they managed to travel to Morocco for this year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>“We used various channels to fundraise for the travel but most importantly the Kibuli Old Students Association (KOSA) and the parents contributed heavily to this cause”. Ssekimwanyi Rashid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>“We took two Basketball 3x3 teams to Morocco in February this year. While the girls won a trophy, the boys did not win any game but this was due to the change in weather and food. I advise the students are briefed before they leave Uganda on the food, weather and anything else they may experience”. Marion Atwegyeise, Buddo SS.</p>

<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Sports like swimming, chess and athletics are selected after a training camp so these are not specifically attached to a single school.<br>The president further explained that at this level schools are at liberty to choose a good student from another school because they participate as countries and not just as schools like at FEASSSA level.<br>In conclusion the schools were strongly advised against falsifying the ages of the participants and that the information they use to apply for passports must tally with that at National Identification Registration Authority (NIRA).<br>Mr. Mugisha Justus thanked the games’ teachers for the work they do to have schools participate in several USSSA championships and activities for example convincing the school directors and headteachers to stretch their budgets so that schools can participate in games.</p>

<p>Verdicts delivered for banned schools at National Football Championship 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The schools that faced bans from USSSA activities during the National Boys Football Championship at Nyakasura School in Kabarole, May 2023, received their verdicts on January 4, 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The disciplinary committee at Nyakasura School heard appeals from schools initially banned from all USSSA activities. Despite one school facing a permanent ban, others were granted reprieves based on compelling evidence presented to the appeals committee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The appeals committee, chaired by Reverend Canon Duncans Mugumya (Commissioner Physical Education and Sports, Ministry of Education and Sports), and vice-chaired by Brother Augustune Mugabo (President, Association of Secondary School Headteachers of Uganda - ASSHU), played a crucial role in the review process. Additional committee members included Christopher Banage Mugisha (CEO USSSA), Patrick Okanya (Emeritus), and Grace Abalo (Senior Education Officer,Ministry of Education and Sports ).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tororo Town College, grappling with five overaged players, faced a permanent ban from USSSA activities. Despite presenting only two disputed students during the appeals process, the school remains banned for 365 days while all the five students are banned from USSSA activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kawempe Royal College found itself banned after a student submitted three different pass slips, each with identical names and results but different dates of birth. The school will face a year-long ban from USSSA activities while the student is banned from any USSSA activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welden High School, Nganwa High School, Royal Giant High School Mityana, and Lammineas, Kyotera (Fresh Dairy Secondary Games in Mbarara) were initially banned due to inconsistencies in pass slips. However, diligent representatives from each school provided substantial evidence to refute any forgery claims, resulting in their clearance to participate in USSSA activities in 2024. Unfortunately, the students involved in these cases remain banned from USSSA games.</p>

The 52 participants hailing from the zones of Bugisu, Bukedi, Teso, Sebei, and Karamoja primarily consist of secondary school teachers dedicated to enhancing their skills in officiating sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Program Inception and Objectives:</strong><br>Mr. Okanya took the opportunity to shed light on the inception of the USSSA Capacity Building Training and the envisioned outcomes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Quality Assurance Measures:</strong><br>Addressing concerns about the perceived dilution of game quality, Okanya reassured the participants that USSSA collaborates with accredited instructors from National Federations. These instructors, assigned by the Federations, bring their expertise to the training sessions, ensuring that participants learn from the best in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The instructors we work with to train you are fully accredited by their respective National Federations, and we work closely with them during the games. Therefore, rest assured that you are learning from the best," affirmed Okanya, dispelling any apprehensions and emphasizing the commitment to maintaining high standards in sports officiation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Empowering Ambassadors:</strong><br>As the session concluded, Okanya reminded the participants that they were now ambassadors of USSSA and encouraged them to contribute positively to their communities. "USSSA has a significant market in schools, providing ample opportunities for each one of you to shine. Seize the chance to practice and thrive in your respective zones, starting now," urged Okanya, highlighting the potential for individual growth and impact within the USSSA framework.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Emphasizing the role of sports in schools and communities, Beatrice encouraged a collective effort to foster growth and development through engagement in USSSA initiatives.</p>

The call to action resonates with the vision of creating empowered ambassadors who contribute to the growth and vibrancy of sports communities across Uganda.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated USSSA Elite Games 2024 is set to commence, promising intense competition from the get-go. Football, as the most favored sport, is expected to take center stage, featuring powerhouse schools eager to make their mark in the tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next three days, Jinja City will come alive with action across five disciplines: football for both boys and girls, netball, volleyball for both boys and girls, handball for both girls and boys and basketball in both 3x3 and 5x5 formats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all participating teams safely arrived in Jinja and having completed their final preparations, the stage is set for the long-awaited kickoff. The only exception is the boys' football category, which will follow a round-robin format, determining the winner based on accumulated points from each match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams to keep a close eye on in the boys' category include defending champions Standard High School Zzana, determined to secure another title after their triumph in the previous edition in Mbarara City. Westville High School, eager for redemption after their fifth-place finish last year, aims to claim their first national prize.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notable among the girls' teams is Kawempe Muslim Secondary School, a proven force with numerous options across all age groups. Despite a quarter-final exit in the Fresh Diary games 2023, Kawempe went on to win prestigious championships in Rwanda and Kenya, securing a spot in the CAF African Schools Championship CECAFA Zone Qualifiers U15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St Noah Girls Secondary School Zzana, known for their entertaining tik-tak football, will be another school to watch. Despite falling short in the Fresh Diary games 2023, they clinched bronze at the ISF football championship in Morocco, earning recognition as the third-best footballing school globally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the absence of St Mary's Kitende, the previous champion, the competition is wide open, with Standard High School Zzana defending their title. Kawempe Muslim Secondary School holds the record with three trophies out of the four previous editions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Last year's 5th-placed Westville High School had a strong start with a 2-1 win over Standard High School Zzana.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Group A, Kawempe Muslim has a good chance of reaching the semi-finals with a point in their final group game against Jinja Secondary School, who have already secured 6 points today.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second day of the Elite games in Jinja saw competition in the Girls' Football category rise as gold is clearly in sight than ever before. Meanwhile, most encounters were won on fine margins and tight score lines as teams stood strong and were hesitant on full-force attacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boni Consili Girl's School had their title hopes dented on Friday early morning as Kawempe outclassed them thanks to a Shadia Nabirye brace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hosts Jinja SS suffered a second straight defeat as St. Noa Girls SS outclassed them with a whooping three goals. However, Jinja SS amended their woes by edging St Stephen SS Budondo courtesy of Gloria Mutesi's second-half goals.</p>

		<Title>USSSA Elite Games: VolleybalL GIANTS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED.</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By Nankya Saudah</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday 27<sup>th</sup> set to be the date of witnessing the overall winner of the volleyball game amidst all girls and boys participating teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the commencement of the 2024 Elite Games in Jinja City, hosted by Jinja College and Jinja Senior Secondary School respectively, the various schools projected a spirited performance both on day 1 and 2. Having faced themselves during the 2 days of games so far, Ngora High School has a higher chance of being crowned this year’s Volleyball Champion after winning all its games against Mariam High School with a 3 : 0, Katikamu SDA with a 3: 1, immaculate heart with a 3 : 0 and Bukedea comprehensive with a 3: 1, we are all right to think and draw conclusions that they will undoubtedly emerge victorious tomorrow during the finals where they will be playing against Bukedea comprehensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> On the boy's side, Standard High School Zana has so far exhibited incredible skills in both their day 1 and 2 games against Jinja Senior Secondary School, Jinja College, and Bukedea Comprehensive School. Unfortunately, both teams from the host schools are below the bottom line. Thus, in this section, the 2 finalists will be confirmed tomorrow after the second team battles with the yet-to-be-established 3<sup>rd</sup> team on the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7878,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Conclusively, those who have lost the game will have to swallow the bitter pill and adopt a few techniques from the outstanding teams so that they can stage a befitting competition in the games ahead.</p>

<p>James Jarieko had the best chance of of second half after a well-delivered cross from Richard Okello but his header near the goalposts went over the bar which left the crowd at Kakindu in embarrassment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite being a holiday, people thought fans would not turn up because students were in break but that was a different story to the fans that the game pulled.</p>

		<Title>USSSA Elite Games girls Football: A deeper insight into the championship surprise team.</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/JudeAtwiine">Atwiine Jude</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Elite games in Jinja had six teams vying for the girls' football gold. The competition was very tight on paper considering the presence of reigning FEASSA Champions Kawempe Muslim SS and former National and FEASSA champions St. Noa who were widely regarded as favourites for this championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isingiro-based Boni Consili Girls' School traveled over 400 km to Jinja to prove a point in the 5th edition of this championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8048,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WhatsApp-Image-2024-01-28-at-23.21.10-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8048"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, under the stewardship of coach Hussein Saidi and his technical bench, Boni Consili capped off the championship by strongly upsetting St. Noa Girls SS in a game that was also witnessed by the Crested Cranes coach Sheryl Botes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8056,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Crested-Cranes-coach-Botes-middle-busy-taking-notes-during-the-USSSA-Elite-girls-football-at-Jinja-SS-2-1024x678.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8056"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crested Cranes coach Botes (middle) busy taking notes during the USSSA Elite girls football at Jinja SS</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boni Consili showed a great level of resilience, grip, and tenacity, especially in a game where they spent large spells in their half defending against the speedy and tricky attackers of St.Noa. In a game where Boni Consili struggled to create many goal-scoring opportunities, they had to be clinical enough in front of goal. Here the tournament's revelation who later ended up as top scorer came to the table. Rina Ariho's close tap-in was just enough to see off the game in their favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8053,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WhatsApp-Image-2024-01-28-at-23.19.58-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8053"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rinah Ariho who is the tournament's top scorer and arguably the MVP of the championship scored 8 goals in 6 games which is more than half of the team's goals.<br>This shows how instrumental she was to the team's success having only failed to score against Kawempe Muslim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8050,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WhatsApp-Image-2024-01-28-at-23.25.08.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8050"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of the championship, Boni Consili Girl's School had scored an impressive 12 goals and conceded only on 4 occasions winning 4 of their 5 games as a result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boni Consili will feel undone but with plenty of positives to take from this year's edition having finished as runners-up just one point behind Kawempe Muslim SS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boni Consili walked away happily with silver. Their next target will be the Fresh Dairy Games 2024 which makes it an even better foundation for young girls.</p>

<p>Old Is Gold, Capacity Building Program Proprietor Addresses The Young ones</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While addressing all the capacity-building trainees at the Elite Games including Referees, Mr Patrick Okanya urged the students to be disciplined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>" Without discipline, you will head nowhere, even if you are a good media officer or referee you will be dumped because of your unsporting and personal behaviors because they tarnish our brand," said Okanya in a brief meeting with the trainees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides discipline you must work hard, you have to deliver your best because you are not the only trained personnel but why are you the only ones here? He posed a touching question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Being here doesn't guarantee you a place to be on our every championship, it's through determination and hard work that you will be available for selection next time and also go for international tournaments" he added</p>

This year, we will provide Administration and event management which includes the secretariat, media, branding, certificate and accreditation, Capacity Building training". President Mugisha.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are going to form a joint sports federation that will unite us since one school's sports association is recognized in each country at the international level" Justus added</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"For capacity building training our target was to train 5000 participants but we managed to train 7524 trainees which was an achievement and 255 of these were Primary School teachers who were trained during the games in Mbarara in September 2023" President Justus Mugisha.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The draw against the physical opponent Cameroon was held at St. Mary’s Stadium-Kitende, on Saturday 3rd February2024 in game that was not allowed to have fans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4th minute, Uganda had an early chance to take the lead after speed merchant Sylivia Kabene was brought down few meters away from the box but saw Agnes Nabukenya's powerful direct shot go over the bar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams failed to control and stabilize the game instead it was up and down play where we saw the game reach 20 minutes with very few chances from both sides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 25th minute, the visitors had a chance to take the lead after Uganda's defensive error which set up Cameroon's forward Fraiche Tiwa Melong Lys one on one with custodian Lilian Nakiirya who stood tall to save Uganda and the score remained level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 34th minute , Bortes' side got a relief with Agnes Nabukenya's goal to put Uganda ahead.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal was a result of a brilliant interplay between Kawempe's Shadia Nabirye and Esther Nangendo where Nabirye finally set up Nabukenya from the left flank to slot the ball past Cameroon custodian Chelsea Ngole.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the poor display from both sides, Agnes' goal was the deference at half time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the start of the second half, Ernestine Heutchou capitalized on Uganda's defensive sleep to go for power outside the box and her shot found the back of the net to level terms in the 50th minute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 83rd minute, Uganda had a chance to take the lead again after a well delivered cross from Sylivia Kabene but Shadia Nabirye right in the middle of the goal struck the ball over the bar but seemingly fauled from behind but the penalty appeal was rubbed with a play on by referee Lamia Atman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 89th minute, Agnes Nabukenya had a chance to double her tally and regain Uganda's lead but her powerful shot outside the 18 yard box went over the bar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game ended level and return leg awaits on 9th February 2024 at Yaounde Stadium in Cameroon.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner on aggregate will face the winner between Zambia and Tanzania at the next round of qualifiers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Under-20 Men's National side commenced their quest for gold at the 13th Edition of the All Africa Games-Accra 2023 last evening with an inspired victory over Nigeria thanks to two super strikes by Usama Arafat and Ivan Irinimbabazi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game saw several very familiar faces from the USSSA National Boys Championship- 2023 take center stage and play a pivotal role in what was a sweet revenge over the Young Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 33rd minute, Allan Oyirwoth ( previously a student at Amus College School) sparked off an attack from deep within his own half to set up Usama Arafat for the first goal of the tournament for Coach Morley Byekwaso's side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Uganda enjoying a lion's share of the ball possession, the Nigerians capitalized on a corner kick which leveled matters for the contest. This set up an even clingy second stanza with both sides looking to find a winner but there was always one inspired side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 81st minute was bound to see Usama Arafat ( former student at St. Mary's Boarding School kitende) present a clear-cut chance in the hands of Ivan Irinimbabazi who made no mistake but to restore Uganda's lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's a list of players that were involved in the clash and their schools</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ronald Madoi -(St. Mary's Boarding School Kitende)<br>Rogers Torach - St. Mary's Boarding School Kitende<br>Allan Oyirwoth - Amus College School (previously)<br>Jonah Patrick Kakande - Uganda Martyrs High School-Lubaga ( previously)<br>Hakim Mutebi - St. Mary's Boarding School Kitende<br>Enock Luyima- St. Mary's Boarding School Kitende<br>John Innocent Kisolo - St. Henry's College Kitovu<br>Shamulan Kamya - Royal Giant High School</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With these youngsters' involvement in the ongoing championship in Ghana, there is a clear path for the development of talents all from school sports to professional level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, all eyes will be on the USSSA National Boys Championship- 2024 in Masaka to watch out for the next crop of players to step on the big stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, Uganda leads Group B by three points, same as Senegal who won 1-0 against South Sudan on the same day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Uganda Hippos will return to action on Monday, 11th March 2024 against Senegal at the same venue.</p>

		<Title>USSSA PRODUCTS Watch: Amus Starboy  strikes Uganda into the Semi-Finals</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All African Games 2023 |By<a href="https://twitter.com/JudeAtwiine"> Jude Atwiine</a> (Photo by FUFA Media)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Uganda Hippos continued with their impressive start into the 13th All Africa Games-Accra 2023. The lads showed up with another fine display against the young lions of Teranga to ensure they collected maximum points on the night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The under-20 men's National team had to wait until the twenty-sixth minute when Usama Arafat was brought down in the forbidden area which earned them a penalty. Allan Oyirwoth was lucky to hit the rebound after his initial shot was saved by the Senegal goalkeeper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Senegalese responded by piling a lot of pressure on the Ugandan wall marshaled by Captain captain Torach Rogers. Royal Giants High School goalkeeper Shamulan Kamya was forced into making a very fine save from a Senegal free kick in the dying minutes of the first stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hippos managed to keep the Senegalese at bay for the rest of the match, they now top the group and have already made it to the semi-finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In a game won by simply fine margins, the USSSA PRODUCTS continued to shine. </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allan Oyirwoth (previously a student at Amus College School) made his second successive start in the championship. He is well known for his goal-scoring prowess from the USSSA National Boys Championship- 2023, to the FEASSA games in Huye Rwanda, and at the ISF Football championship in Morocco. He had his strike from the penalty spot initially saved but was lucky to make amends with a rebound. His goal proved to be a winner for coach Morley Byekwaso's side</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shamulan Kamya a student at Royal Giants High School getting his first start at the games replacing Abdu Magada who sustained an injury. Kamya showed no nerves as he was forced into making a very fine save in the dying minutes of halftime. A simple touch on the ball parried the ball onto the crossbar bar keeping Uganda in the lead hence preserving his clean sheet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

		<Title>ALL AFRICA GAMES 2023: USSSA PRODUCTS WATCH</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All African Games 2023 |By<a href="https://twitter.com/JudeAtwiine"> Jude Atwiine</a> (Photos by FUFA Media)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Queen Cranes made their mark in the 13th All Africa Games-Accra last evening against Tanzania in the Junior East African Derby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the bright stadium lights of Cape Coast, the anticipation was palpable as the teams took their positions. The whistle blew and the game sprang to life with both sides eager to stamp their authority on the match from the get-go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Midfield battles became a heartbeat of the dugout as players clashed with a mix of skill and determination, each pass and move building the story of a thrilling encounter. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gne3Xh56w7c">In the 41st minute, Margaret Kunihira pounced on a well-threaded pass from Zaina Nandede to give coach Sheryl Botes' side a deserved lead. </a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a disappointing end was always on the cards with the Queen Cranes failing to capitalize on their chances on several occasions. The Tanzanians salvaged a draw with one minute to the end of the regular ninety minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Queen Cranes failing to start their campaign on a high note, it was rather eye-watering to watch very familiar faces from the Fresh Dairy Games 2023 and the just concluded USSSA Elite Games-  Jinja 2024. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team's Skipper on the night, a very fast-paced winger from St. Noa Girls' School Catherine Nagadya was one of those who caused several problems to the Tanzanians' defense, especially with her pinpoint deliveries from set pieces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda Martyrs High School-Lubaga was well represented on the night with three of their players making it into the starting eleven on the night. Showstopper Sharon  Kaidu, Latifah Nakasi, and  Shamsa Najjuma who were all influential in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here's a list of players involved on the matchday and their respective schools</strong></p>

		<Title>USSSA Products Watch : Hakim Mutebi Steers Uganda Into a Maiden Final</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Uganda under-20 men's national team, the Hippos passed  the Champions mentality test last evening as they fought back from a two goal deficit against Congo in the Men's football semi-final at the All Africa Games in Ghana</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda booked a slot in the final after defeating Congo 4-2 thanks to second half goals by Bruno Bunyaga who scored a brace, Abbas Kyeyune and Hakim Mutebi. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"width":"972px","height":"auto","sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJDv6ZRWIAAyndE?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="" style="width:972px;height:auto" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having suffered a very slow start in the first half, the boys found themselves with a huge load of work to breakdown the congolese defence whose striking line too had the hippos trailing by two goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> However, one man was ready to rise to the occasion. From Uganda Martyrs Primary School Lubaga to St. Mary's Boarding School Kitende, Hakim Mutebi was the final piece to complete the puzzle for tactician Morley Byekwaso side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hakim brought the mental toughness to the game having replaced former Royal Giants High School starlet Ivan Irinimbabazi just at the start of the second stanza. Hakim came in with that much needed extra desire and maturity to this young side to stage a come back in a game where the Congolese thought they had put out of reach for team Uganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> At a very young age, Hakim boosts having quite a number of gold medals in his bag already. Having won the <strong>USSSA </strong>National Boys  Championship in Fortportal 2023, he followed it up with  the <strong>FEASSA</strong> Boys Football gold medal the same year in Huye Rwanda. Hakim closed the year by adding the <strong>CECAFA</strong> under 18 Boys Championship Kenya-2023 trophy to his cabin with an MVP accolade too. How many eighteen year olds can say the same? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"width":"1005px","height":"auto","sizeSlug":"large"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  Having come through the ranks of football development in the country, and now looking forward to bolster his trophy cabin with the <strong>All Africa Games - 2023</strong> gold . Hakim is whole definition of progress, resilience and hardwork. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>USSSA National Boys Football Championship 2024</strong> is just a blink away and the qualifiers are already in top gear in various regions across the country. With Masaka Secondary School  the centre stage of this action, who will be the next Hakim Mutebi coming through the ranks?</p>

<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alliance put up a five star performance having scored 3 times inside the opening first fifteen minutes of the first half. The worst was yet to prevail for St. George as Alliance found no trouble playing through their defence. Following the victory, Alliance High School will face even tougher opponents from other mini-zones like Aggrey, Nsangi among others to qualify for the National finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>  In the boys duel, Greenlight Islamic got the best of starts by scoring in the first minute of the game as they halted the five year dominance of  London College- Nansana. Sudaisi Kayiira got quite unlucky as the ball bounced off his shin into his own net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moments later, captain Junior Egesa jumped highest to head the ball from a corner  kick doubling Greenlight's advantage. Maurice Okello made the game 3-0 just nine minutes into the second stanza that killed any hopes of a come back.  </p>

<p>In the other final, Jinja Progressive Academy girls team came from a goal down to force a draw against fierce rivals Jinja Secondary School in a very tense match played before a throng of spectators early in the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jinja SS led majority of the game by 1-0 thanks to an early first half goal but could not hold their nerves for the rest of the game as JIPRA piled a lot pressure on their defence.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jinja Secondary School who were the better side for the majority of the game succumbed to Jinja Progressive Academy in spot kicks. Jinja Progressive won 3-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also vital to note that Jinja Progressive also won the boys duel in the Elite Games Boys final that was  played at Kakindu stadium early in January this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory battle for bragging rights remained tilted on JIPRA side as they secured their second trophy this year </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the finalists will await to play even much stronger sides at the zonal level in the USSSA Zonal Qualifiers 2024. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The battle to book spots in the USSSA National Football Boys Championship- Masaka and the Fresh Dairy Ball Games 1 is getting even much tastier.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teso zone confirmed its representatives in the forthcoming <strong>Fresh Dairy Games-Girls Football </strong>and <strong>National Boys Football Championship Masaka-2024.</strong> The zonal qualifiers finals  were played at Ngora High School in Ngora District on 1st April 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Teso zone which bears four slots for either championship, it means that all semi finalists are through to the National Championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the girls football category, <strong>Bukedea </strong>district champions Amus College School continued their magic to conquer the region having won 1-0 against Onset Secondary School in a closely contested final. Al Mahad Ibn Umar's second half strike was enough to seal Amus' victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9246} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG-20240401-WA0181-1-1024x888.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9246" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amus College thumped Labira Girls School 8-0 in the semi final while Onset Secondary School ejected Bukedea Comprehensive School at the same stage. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9247,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This therefore means all the four schools have booked their slots in the Fresh Dairy Games where Amus will hope to defend their crown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile in the boys duel, hosts Ngora High School were outpowered by Amus College School in the semi finals as Amus won 1-0.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second semi-final of the day, <strong>Kaberamaido </strong>district's <strong>Kobulubulu Secondary School </strong>conquered <strong>Bukedea Comprehensive School </strong>8-7 on penalties having played out a stalemate in regular time. The boys' final date will be communicated by the Teso Region organising Committee. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<Title>Victory Road to Nationals: Fort Portal SS and Moons Vocational indomitable.</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fort City's Fort Portal SS were crowned the Zonal Boys football champions as they outwitted Kyabenda SS having come back from a goal down to win 3-1 thanks to a Zilgar Ogwar hatrick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9283,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240405_214014.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9283"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jordan Tugume put Kyabenda SS ahead just seconds after kick off capitalizing on Fort portal SS defensive flaws. This however invited a lot of pressure as Fort Portal SS showed that mettle and champions mentality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fort Portal star boy Zilgar rose to the occasion levelling matters and later running the show on their journey to championship victory. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile in the Fresh Dairy Secondary School Games girls Football Final, Moons Vocational School defeated Nyakigumba Secondary School to lift the girls football trophy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a game where either team gave away less opportunities to the opponent the goal margin clearly describes how cagey it was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9285,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Moons Vocational managed to come out on top as Rwenzori champions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rwenzori Zone will be represented by three teams both in boys and girls category insinuating that the third place play-off winner joins the champion and the other finalist on the match to the table of men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In the boys category, Fort Portal SS, Kyabenda SS, and Maddox SS will lift the Rwenzori flag and like wise Moons Vocational School, Nyakigumba Secondary School, and Nyakisenyi Secondary School for the girls.</strong></p>

		<Title>USSSA Qualifiers: Holders Buddo register biggest win on Day one</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wakiso Zonal Qualifiers kicked off today Monday, April 8 as 32 teams faced off in thrilling clashes in front of huge crowds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holders Buddo SS clearly showed their intentions of seeking to defend the title right from day one of the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nsagi Zone finalists played two games scoring a total of 10 goals and conceding none. They also registered the biggest win of the day as they thumped Kajjansi Progressive 9-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Elsewhere, Light High Seguku secured a 6-0 victory against Kakungulu High School in one of the most entertaining duels of the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abedeen Abdulkarim (brace), Benard Bagambe, Emmanuel Nabola and Peter Hire were on the score sheet as the Seguku-based side gathered maximum points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still with day one action, St Mary’s Kitende registered two victories in as many games played. In their first game of the day, Kitende secured a 4-0 win before beating God Cares 6-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National champions used two different starting lineups in either game something that the gaffer Daniel Male attributed to testing different players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the ongoing championship, Kitende will try and end Buddo’s regional dominance since they (Kitende) have lost to the latter in more than two finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Action will continue tomorrow on day two of the championship as the 32 sides continue to vie for the available five slots for the upcoming Nationals.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All seemed to go their way and victory was on their cards but Kitovu's Jonathan Kyalema thought differently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jonathan brought the game back to level terms at the full hour mark to breed hopes back into their travelling fans.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masaka SS crumbled in the spot kicks  handing St. Henry's College the crown after their 4-2 penalty score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> <strong>Who will represent Masaka at the Nationals</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is key to note that Masaka Zone will table four representatives to battle for the 2024 Boys Football crown on home soil as per slots allocation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, <strong>Masaka SS</strong> already had their spot <em>beneath their armpits </em>as the hosts. Therefore they will be joined by Masaka champions <strong>St. Henry's College Kitovu</strong>, <strong>Blessed Sacrament SS Kimanyi</strong> and zone semi finalists <strong>Sseke Secondary School </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blessed Sacrament beat Sseke SS 3-2 in a five goal thriller earlier in the third place play off in the bid to book themselves a ticket to the National showpiece.</p>

<p><strong>USSSA Games 2024 | Final</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>St Mary’s Kitende 1-0 Buddo SS</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St Mary’s Kitende secured a 1-0 victory against Buddo Secondary School in the USSSA Wakiso Regional Football final at Kabaka Kyabaggu on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kitende finally ended Buddo’s regional dominance with a narrow victory infront of a huge crowd at Wakisha ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tight game that gave the crowd a perfect feeling of two sides in a derby fighting for glory, prestige and bragging rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hassan Mubiru fired Kitende ahead with a powerful strike from close range in the 15th minute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Juma Sajjabi’s curling delivery beat Buddo’s backline to meet Mubiru on the far post who calmed the ball before slotting home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ten minutes later, Buddo nearly levelled matters through George Kato but Kitende’s right back Samuel Mubiru made a timely block.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From that point it was a see-saw effort, as either side got a fair share of possession but failed to capitalize on the chances created.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, Kitende got two glorious chances to seal the game but Isa Bugembe and Arafat Nkoola’s effort went narrowly wide of the target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the last minutes of the Kitende thought they had doubled their lead through Sajjabi’s freekick but Buddo’s custodian Edrisa Wayibi made a superb save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With five minutes left on the clock Buddo’s defensive midfielder Ntambi made a nasty challenge on Claude Makenge and he was given a red card.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third place play off was won by Standard High Zanna who beat Andy Mwesigwa 5-4 after a two-all draw in normal time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wakiso Region will be represented by six schools namely; St Mary’s Kitende, Buddo SS, Standard High, Andy Mwesigwa, Kakungulu High and Kyadondo SS in the forthcoming USSSA Nationals that will be hosted by Masaka SS later this month.</p>

		<Title>BUKEDI ZONAL QUALIFIERS 2024</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/USSSAOnline/status/1767587760066429106?t=xXYEip4CR53YyncNyyUYfw&amp;s=19">USSSA</a> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bukedi Zonal Qualifiers convened in Pallisa, one of the pivotal districts among the seven constituting Bukedi. Tororo, Pallisa, Busia, Budaka, Kibuku, and Butebo showcased their premier teams in a bid for glory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the inaugural day, the Chairperson of Bukedi Zone USSSA Mr Enyanda Dominic Maloba emphasized the need for a fair competition, cautioning against result manipulation and migration from Teso Zone. Screenings concluded at 6 pm, with no nocturnal sessions permitted. Original documentation was mandated, fostering an atmosphere of equitable play amongst participants, setting the stage for the subsequent events, including a procession through Pallisa town to Busitema University, the official launch venue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day two witnessed a surge of excitement with 27 boys' teams and 24 girls' teams vying for the coveted prize. Former Powerhouses like St. Peters College Tororo and Manjasi surged into the tournament as wild cards, juxtaposing themselves against lesser-known schools in the region who actually gave them a run for their money. Drawings were held to determine match-ups for the teams advancing to the round of 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day three unraveled with captivating clashes as teams battled fiercely for progression. Notable encounters included Apopong Seed Secondary School edging out Ezra Memorial and Alliance High School triumphing over Luma Eastern College. Turmoil ensued with a Tororo Progressive Academy's petition against St. Paul, ultimately leading to their qualification for the Quarterfinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day four, the climax of the tournament, brimmed with anticipation. In the Quarterfinals, Apopong Seed eliminated Busia SS, Tororo Progressive Academy triumphed over St. Peters College Tororo in a derby, High Light outshined Buhobe SS, and Alliance High School overcame Hill View.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the girls' category, St. Claire Girls of Budaka, Pallisa Progressive, St. Peters Amusala, and Asinge SS showcased their prowess, advancing to the semi-finals. Alliance and High Light secured their spots in the boys' final, while St. Peters Amusala faced Asinge SS in the girls' final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The action-packed final day witnessed a spectacle as supporters flocked Kaucho Grounds in what could be perhaps the most watched Girls finals in the history of Bukedi USSSA. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Peters Amusala dominated emerged as the better side beating Asinge SS 4-0. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, almost a mile away at Busitema University grounds known to the locals as Kalaki, High Light SS emerged victorious in the boys' category, with Alliance High School settling for second place and TOPA sealing off the third spot with a win over Apopong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><strong>Bukedi will be proudly represented by High Light SS, Alliance High School, and TOPA in the boys' category, alongside St. Peters Amusala and Asinge SS in the girls' category.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The closing ceremony was honored by the presence of Madam Alwenyi, the guest of honor and USSSA EXCOM representative. She extended her gratitude to the Organizers, Mr. Maloba, his dedicated team, the chairperson of ASSHU, referees, games teachers, and the community of Pallisa. Encouraging the Bukedi representative schools, <strong>she emphasized the importance of striving even harder at the Nationals in Masaka and Luwero.</strong></p>

<p><em>Police now to help in the fight against impersonators, none bona-fide, and over aged players in school sport</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9706,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240426_182932-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9706" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022, when the present USSSA executive committee was elected, it set its number one objective, riding school sport of impersonators, none bona-fide, and over-age players in school sports. Luckily, this resonated well with ASSHU, PES, and the Ministry of Education and Sports. The Parliament of Uganda has also joined the fight by enacting a law that criminalizes the above and sets very serious sanctions to the offenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2022, USSSA has strengthened rules and regulations to ensure that real students of actual age participate in school games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2023, a student registration system was introduced to help in the fight and overtime, new guidelines for registration, screening of players, and sanctioning of offending schools, administrators, and players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, organizers at some districts and zones decided to disregard the set regulations and guidelines. In the end, many teams have been declared to represent zones in the national games by fielding those who do not qualify to play in students' games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the pre tournament screening exercise at the USSSA head office, a number of teams failed to raise the necessary 20 students to participate in the national games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Any team that presents 5 or more students that do not qualify may be disqualified from participating in the national games</em> . Additionally, as sanction to the zone that presents such a team, <em>A slot is lost to other zones with clean teams</em>. It's hoped that these measures will force those zones to be more serious in implementing USSSA rules, regulations and guidelines in future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pre tournament screening involves scrutinizing the original documents of players and subjecting them to EMIS, UNEB, national federations and where possible, NIRA registration systems. Any discrepancy in these may lead to disqualification of a player and / or a school team in line with tournament rules and regulations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pre tournament screening will be followed by physical screening at the tournament venue.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We have strict instructions from the minister of state for education and sports Hon Peter Ogwang to refer cases of impersonation to police</em>. We made arrangements to have police at the screening venues at Masaka SSS and Ndejje SS, who will handle such cases. Head Teachers, Games teachers, and coaches are hereby requested to be more careful with the team they present.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Finally, students of actual age have a chance to participate in their games</em></p>

		<Title>USSSA Games: Denis Kisiriko guides Kitende past resilient Kisozi Seed</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Denis Kisiriko’s lonely strike helped St Mary’s Kitende secure a 1-0 victory past resilient Kisozi Seed School in the ongoing 2024 USSSA Games at Masaka Recreational Centre on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The games kicked off late as the secretariat delayed a bit to get done with screening though at exactly 2:00 PM were underway at Masaka Recreational Centre.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kitende started on the front foot seeking an early lead but Kisozi Seed’s backline was well-organised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9725,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG-20240427-WA0179-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9725" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before the break, the holders increased pace upfront as Hassan Mubiru gave a hard time to Kisozi’s hardworking backline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kisiriko once again staged his poaching skills as he fired the holders in the lead from close range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kisozi Seed School will have several lessons to pick from because their backline looked decent against a star-studded backline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the game, Kisiriko revealed that his target is to take home the top scorer’s gong just like it was in the Wakiso Regional Qualifiers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am longing to score more goals so that I can get the Golden Boot,” the forward stated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“However the priority is to score goals that help the team because our target is to defend the trophy and am confident we can do it,” he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kitende are the defending champions of this championship having edged St Henry’s Kitovu 1-0 in last year’s final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, they are also record 11 times champions sharing the throne with arch-rivals Kibuli Secondary School.</p>

		<Title>USSSA Games: Amus set campaign target after slim victory against Ryakasinga</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amus College School secured a hard fought 1-0 victory against Ryakasinga in the ongoing 2024 USSSA Games at St Kitovu ground one on Saturday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hakim Musaba broke the deadlock in the 65th minute with a simple tap in after Ryakasinga’s custodian failed to grip a long range free kick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amus College created several chances but were not lethal enough and found themselves struggling to take the lead in a game they had an upper hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the full-time whistle, Amus head coach Nimrod Kintu revealed that amidst a poor start the target for this year’s championship is to lift the trophy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We did not have the best game today but what matters is attaining maximum points,” Kintu told USSSA Media.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We shall continue preparing the boys because I know how good they are. I will continue to remind you that this year we want the trophy,” he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we managed to reach the semifinals last year, then we only have to work on our mistakes and see that we perform better because we have all it takes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paidha Secondary School and St Juliana Seeta shared spoils after one-all stalemate in the ongoing 2024 USSSA National Games on Sunday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simon Wanyama scored for St Juliana Seeta in the first stanza before Paidha SS leveled matters in the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game delayed by 20 minutes but as soon as Paidha Secondary School arrived at the ground they were sent onto the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suprisingly, even without warming up Paidha SS started on the front foot creating several chances but hardly utilized their chances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>James Ssekate thought he had given St Juliana the lead but it was flagged offside as he wheeled away into celebrations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simon Wanyama finally broke the deadlock, shirt 9 won possession before he laid a cut back. Ssekate’s effort was blocked by the custodian before Wanyama tapped home from close range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five minutes into the second stanza, Javine Mungdit leveled matters with an easy finish after St Julian failed to clear their lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the final minutes it was one way traffic as St Julian threw all bodies upfront to regain their lead but Paidha SS stood tall to ensure they secure the golden point.</p>

		<Title>USSSA Games: Blessed Sacrament seal group stage with victory against Highway Kiganda</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blessed Sacrament Kimanya secured a well-deserved 3-0 victory against Highway Kiganda in the ongoing 2024 USSSA Games at Sports Arena on Monday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blessed Sacrament played their last group game with a lot of swag and confidence as they secured the third win in as many games played.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patrick Mark Kafeero fired Blessed Sacrament ahead with a direct free kick that left Highway’s custodian totally beaten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the end of the first stanza, Joel Kyeyune doubled Blessed Sacrament’s victory with a simple tap in from close range after a team attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blessed Sacrament went into the second stanza with a man less, not because they received a red but the coach decided to play the other 35 minutes with 10 players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with a man less, Blessed Sacrament extended their lead with Arnold Kayemba’s spectacular finish that left Highway’s backline helpless on the floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the final whistle, Blessed Sacrament head coach Abby Kakumirizi revealed that they are happy to qualify for the round of 32 however they will take one game at a time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are happy to reach this level (round of 32) because it has not been an easy journey to reach this far,” he stated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I want to thank the players that have put up a great show to win three games in the group. We don’t want to say that now the target is to win the trophy because want to plan for one game at a time,” he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The gaffer also added that playing the second half with a man less was intentional because they wanted to reduce the tempo of the game and resort to possession.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blessed Sacrament Kimanya will return to action on Wednesday as they play at the round of 32 in the ongoing championship.</p>

<p>St Mary's Kitende secured a 2-0 victory against Blessed Sacrament Kimanya in the ongoing 2024 USSSA Games at Sports Arena on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fans' favourite Blessed Sacrament Kimanya was ejected from the tournament thanks to St Mary's Kitende's well-deserved victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kitende took an early lead through Isa Bugembe who nodded home Hassan Mubiru's delivery in the sixth minute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite being a goal down, Kimanya kept composed and tried to build from the back but was challenged by a waterlogged pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bugembe nearly doubled Kitende's lead but narrowly missed to connect with Hakim Mutebi's delightful finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9971,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240503-WA0187-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9971" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight minutes to the break, towering defender Ronald Madoi scored Kitende's second goal with a powerful header off Mutebi's header.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the mammoth crowd and chants, Kimanya was trailing by two goals at halftime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 50th minute, Denis Kisiriko failed to convert from close range with only a goalkeeper to beat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the final minutes, second-half substitute Arafat Nkoola went past Kitende's backline but his resultant effort bounced off the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the final whistle, Kitende's head coach Daniel Male revealed that they were prepared to play in front of a huge crowd and take away their chances.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's been a tough game since we were against a home team that was backed up by a huge crowd. But we came prepared and we had to take away our chances," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We knew their backline is made up of short players and so we resorted to long balls that yielded two goals before the break," he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We now shift our attention to the next game because each game matters till the end of the tournament. I will keep rallying the boys to fight so that we defend the title."</p>

		<Title>TEAM UGANDA ENJOYED MAGICAL KENYA BEYOND THE RUNNING COURSE.</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the ISF World School championship was concluded the athletes from all over the world had a chance to experience Kenya and all it had to offer. This was true to the President Ruto’s words during his speech at the Ngong race course where the athletes run and Kenya came first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Welcome to Kenya, to those who have come from far, this is home make it your home and know that Nairobi still has more to offer just make time explore Magical Kenya’. Said His Excellency William Ruto, the President of Kenya.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the athletes in Team Uganda (under 12 and under 15) this was their very first time to visit a new country and as Ibn Battuta said “Travelling-it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A visit to the Nairobi National Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While they relaxed after a race day, the athletes visited Nairobi National Park, the oldest park in Kenya (gazetted in 1946). The athletes had a chance to walk at their own pace saw several animals for example the cheetahs, hyenas, buffaloes, giraffes, ostriches but to the awe of most Ugandans a crested crane.</p>

<p>A visit to the Bomas of Kenya.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bomas of Kenya is a tourist village in Niarobi.Bomas means traditional villages belonging to several Kenyan tribes which simply justifies the several huts around the leafy area. A stone throw away from Nairobi National Park, Bomas of Kenya is home to one of the largest auditoriums in Africa. At this iconic location athletes planted trees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Friendship Relay</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a visit to the Nairobi National Park the athletes were put in groups from A to M, each country could only have one athlete per group and these run a short relay within the bomas of Kenya, handing over a baton (in form of a Masaai Irungu) to the next athletes. This race was purely a fun race and good way for athletes to know each other more and interact better.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crowning part of the whole championship saw athletes exchange different items, momentous and even jackets as souvenirs to take back to their various countries and continents. This was such a fun thing to do for all athletes that got a chance to exchange attire.</p>

<p>After all the exchanges came the cultural night, all athletes had to make a 3 to 5-minute presentation of their respective countries. The presentation could be dance or poem but most danced except for Ireland that presented a poem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The performances were in alphabetical order and Uganda was the last one to perform before hosts Kenya crowned the event up. Throughout the performances anyone could join in and dance alongside the performers, everyone absolutely loved this part and will live to remember.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there, the minister expressed disappointment with how work is slowly going on most especially on the side of playing facilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"With only 40 days left, we cannot be in this state of progress. We have to double our efforts because this benefits Uganda as a country but nevertheless the hope is still high that we shall host these games come August.<br>Our work as government is to see that these games are hosted in Eastern Uganda holistically" Ogwang said.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The minister observed that in the two host schools work is going on but at a slow pace and this may affect the country's hope of hosting these games in the region but ruded the efforts of the two host schools as he promised continuous supervision both from him and the Local Organizing Committee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his address, the minister delivered the good news of the head of state officiating the games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This hosting is historical that the head of state the President H.E Yoweri Kaguta Museveni and the first lady who is also the minister of Education and Sports Mama Janet Kataha Museveni will be guests to this event." Ogwang noted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The FEASSA inspection delegation will be in the country from Monday 17th to Thursday 21st July to check on the preparedness as far as hosting is concerned.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>USSSA President who also doubles as the FEASSA President Justus Mugisha expressed his gratitude to the minister for accepting to be the Chairperson National Organising committee and noted that as a country there is trust in the minister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We thank you for accepting to be the chairman NOC, we know that you have never failed. What we thought couldn't be possible is going to be possible because you accepted."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also noted that he had a lot of trust in the people behind the schools that are to host the games however, added that there is another option in case the two schools fail.</p>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The reputation of the people behind the schools gives us confidence and we are so hopeful that whatever isn't done yet will be done. Even when we were picking the host, we had plan B in Namilyango College as communicated during the bidding process. We have notified them and are also ready in case the worst comes to worst." Justus said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Uganda is hosting for the 6th time and there is no time we have been as organized as this time. In the 21 editions, no head of state has ever graced the event, this goes into history as the first of its kind so lets support the two schools."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also assured the minister of the readiness of the teams to represent Uganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The teams going to feature don't only have national exposure, they have gone to the international stage, represented ably which makes us believe that we have very good teams and we are going to make sure over-aged players don't feature in these games." Mugisha added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having looked at all factors, we believe Uganda will host, hosting FEASSA gives us even more ground ahead of hosting the AFCON and other Continental events.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second half was a much balanced end to end action packed as either side pushed for a goal. Neither of the two was able to utilize the clear cut chances they managed with Sheema Girls denied by the wood work on two occasions while Sacred Heart often lacked the final pass.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Shamusa Najjuma and Sharon Kanyiginya first half goals were enough for Uganda Martyrs Lubaga to see off a resilient Boni Consili who only managed to pull a single goal back. The two played in the second classification of the day for positions 5-8.</cite></blockquote>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kampala zone champions Uganda Martyrs High School Lubaga had a great start to the game scoring twice in the Opening ten minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shamusa Najjuma </strong>came up with an out of the world strike where she caught Boni Consili's shotstopper in no man's land to give the Lubaga side an early lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kiddas continued to pile pressure on the Boni Consili defence where their efforts were rewarded in the 9th minute where <strong>Sharon Kanyiginya </strong>shot deflected off the defender to beat Ninsima Benitah the Amus goalie.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all seemed like a smooth ride for Uganda Martyrs until the 29th minute where <strong>Ariho Rinah</strong> pulled one back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Boni Consili goal was the turning point of the game as they were more direct which caused Uganda Martyrs plenty of problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda Martyrs fended off the pressure and held onto their lead which takes them to vie for 5/6th position.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rines SS struck first in the first half with Rinah Ayerango's eighteenth minute header making the difference on the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amus who were second best in most parts of the first period, suffered as they couldn't match the pace of Rines' forwards.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amus College's best chance came in the 34th minute where Edinah Wandera sliced through Rines' defence to set up Edna Wanda on her right. Rines goalie had all it took to save Wanda's strike  and a corner was the best they attained from the move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 50th minute goal scorer Ayerango turned provider to Halima Mupyanga with a sweet cross.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Halima's header squandered Amus' hopes for a comeback as they failed to create any clear cut chances.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, Rines SS will wait for winner between Kawempe Muslim SS and St. Noa Girls' School to know their opponent in the final while Amus College will play the loser in the same fixture.</p>

<p><strong>BALL GAMES II</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Uganda Secondary Schools Sports Association (USSSA) has announced the split of Ball Games II. This is the largest championship and has attracted even more games. Just last year, the championship brought together over 7,000 participants and officials</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The split has been due to the introduction of the under-16 category games and new disciplines namely mind games(Luddo, Chess, and Scrabble) which has led to the surge of participants and officials from 7,000 to over 11,000. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda's basketball team fell short against Mongolia, losing 51-50 in a nail-biting contest today. Despite leading the first two quarters, Uganda's momentum faltered in the third, allowing Mongolia to tie the game in the final quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edrine Ekau emerged as Uganda's standout player, scoring an impressive 20 points. However, the team's inability to secure a win means they missed an opportunity to cement their quarterfinal spot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uganda now tops Group D with 5 points, while Serbia and Mongolia trail closely with 4 points each. The team will face Serbia in their final group fixture on Saturday, 29th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach Egau Jonathan attributed the loss to his team's lack of focus and failure to follow instructions. "The boys lacked concentration on the court, and we failed to win comfortably as we had planned. They relaxed and didn't follow instructions," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Coach Egau remains optimistic, viewing this setback as a valuable lesson for both the players and the technical team. "This will serve as a lesson for us in the upcoming games," he added.</p>

<p>The Ugandan girls' basketball team got off to a disappointing start at the ISF World Schools Basketball Championship, losing to Chinese Taipei 43-69.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abigail Mpoza Lucy was a bright spot for Uganda, showcasing her skills in defense and transition play. Despite her efforts, the team struggled to keep pace with their opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match seemed to slip away from Uganda's grasp from the outset, with Chinese Taipei dominating all four quarters. The final whistle blew with the scoreboard reading 43-69 in favor of the Taiwanese team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach Jonathan Egau attributed the loss to his team's respect for their opponents and poor game management. "The girls panicked and failed to handle the speedy and accurate Chinese Taipei team," he said. "We could have closed the gap, but poor game management and concentration held us back."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the setback, Coach Egau remains optimistic about his team's chances in the tournament. "We will work on improving our defense, shooting, and game management," he said. "We still have a chance to advance to the next level, and we're determined to grab it."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ugandan team, the only African representative in Group C, will face China 2 on Thursday, June 27th, at 11:45 local time (6:45 AM EAT). With a renewed focus on strategy and teamwork, they hope to bounce back from this initial loss and make a stronger showing in the tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team's next match against China 2 promises to be a thrilling encounter, with Uganda seeking redemption and China 2 looking to maintain their momentum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ISF World Schools Basketball Championship continues to showcase the talents of young basketball players from around the world, with Uganda's team determined to make their mark on the competition.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":10995,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://usssaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG-20240628-WA0135-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10995"/></figure>
